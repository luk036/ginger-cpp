The `aberth_mt()` function is a multithreaded implementation of Aberth's method, an algorithm used primarily in numerical analysis and computational algebra for finding the roots of polynomials. It employs a divide-and-conquer strategy by distributing the workload across multiple threads to speed up computations, taking advantage of modern CPUs with multiple cores.

### Function Signature and Purpose

```cpp
std::pair<int, bool> aberth_mt(const std::vector<double>& coeffs, std::vector<std::complex<double>>& zs, const Options& options);
```

- **Input Parameters:**
  - `coeffs`: A vector of coefficients representing a polynomial. The coefficients are ordered from highest to lowest degree, e.g., for a polynomial `a_n*x^n + a_{n-1}*x^{n-1} + ... + a_1*x + a_0`, `coeffs` would be `{a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1, a_0}`.
  - `zs`: A mutable reference to a vector of initial guesses (`Complex<double>`) for the roots of the polynomial. These will be refined through iterations to approximate the actual roots.
  - `options`: An instance of a struct (`Options`) containing parameters to control the behavior of the algorithm, typically including the maximum number of iterations (`max_iters`) and the tolerance level for convergence (`tolerance`).

- **Return Value:**
  - Returns a pair consisting of:
    - An integer (`int`) representing the number of iterations performed before either reaching convergence or exceeding the maximum allowed iterations.
    - A boolean (`bool`) indicating whether the algorithm converged (true) or reached the maximum iterations without converging (false).

### Algorithm Overview

1. **Initialization:** The function begins by setting up some variables and making preparations for the multithreaded execution. It calculates `degree`, the degree of the polynomial, and adjusts the polynomial coefficients (`coeffs1`) to prepare them for use in the iterative process.

2. **ThreadPool Setup:** It creates a `ThreadPool` using all available hardware concurrency (number of CPU cores), which manages the creation and execution of tasks across these cores.

3. **Iteration Loop:** For each iteration up to `options.max_iters`:
   - It initializes a tolerance value for the current iteration.
   - Each root estimation task is submitted to the thread pool. Each task involves calling `aberth_job` for a specific root guess, which updates the guess based on the Aberth's method formula and checks for convergence.
   - Results from each task are collected asynchronously using `std::future`. The tolerance value is updated with the maximum tolerance calculated across all tasks to track overall convergence progress.
   - If the calculated tolerance falls below `options.tolerance`, indicating that the roots have been approximated within the desired precision, the function returns early with success.

4. **Convergence Check and Cleanup:** After the loop, if no iteration met the convergence criteria, the function returns the final iteration count along with a failure status.

### Key Aspects of Multithreading

- **Parallel Execution:** By utilizing a thread pool, `aberth_mt` divides the work of updating each root guess among separate threads, which can execute simultaneously on different cores, leading to potential speedups on multi-core systems.
- **Synchronization:** Care is taken to avoid race conditions when accessing shared data like `zs` and `converged`. The use of `std::ref` allows passing references to these vectors safely to the worker threads, and each thread only modifies its assigned portion of `zs`. However, it's crucial to ensure that access to shared state is properly synchronized to prevent data corruption.
- **Efficiency Considerations:** While parallelization can speed up computation, there are overhead costs associated with creating and managing threads, especially for smaller problem sizes. Therefore, the effectiveness of this multithreaded approach depends on the size of the polynomial and the specifics of the hardware being used.
