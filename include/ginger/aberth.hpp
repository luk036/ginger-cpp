/**
 * @brief Single-threading Aberth-Ehrlich method
 *
 * The `aberth` function is a multi-threaded implementation of the Aberth-Ehrlich method for finding
 * the roots of a polynomial.
 *
 * Aberth's method is a method for finding the roots of a polynomial that is
 * robust but requires complex arithmetic even if the polynomial is real. This
 * is because it starts with complex initial approximations.
 *
 * @param[in] coeffs The `coeffs` parameter is a vector representing the coefficients of a
 * polynomial. Each element of the vector corresponds to a term in the polynomial, starting from the
 * highest degree term and ending with the constant term. For example, if the polynomial is `3x^2 +
 * 2x +
 * @param[in] zs `zs` is a vector of complex numbers representing the initial guesses for the roots
 * of the polynomial. The function will update these values iteratively to converge to the actual
 * roots.
 * @param[in] options The `options` parameter is an object of type `Options` that contains the
 * maximum number of iterations (`max_iters`) and the tolerance (`tolerance`). These options control the
 * convergence criteria for the Aberth-Ehrlich method.
 *
 * @return The `aberth` function returns a `std::pair<unsigned int, bool>`. The first element of the
 * pair represents the number of iterations performed, and the second element represents whether the
