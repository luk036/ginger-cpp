 * @brief Multi-threading Bairstow's method (even degree only)
 *
 * The `pbairstow_even` function implements Bairstow's method for finding the roots of a real
 * polynomial with an even degree using multi-threading.
 *
 * @param[in] coeffs The `coeffs` parameter is a vector representing the coefficients of the
 * polynomial. Each element of the vector corresponds to the coefficient of a term in the
 * polynomial, starting from the highest degree term and ending with the constant term. For example,
 * if the polynomial is `3x^2 +
 * 2
 * @param[in, out] vrs `vrs` is a vector of iterates, which represents the initial guesses for the
 * roots of the polynomial. The Bairstow's method will update these iterates iteratively until the
 * desired tolerance is reached or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
 * @param[in] options The `options` parameter is an object of type `Options` which contains the
 * maximum number of iterations (`max_iters`) and the tolerance (`tolerance`). These options are used to
 * control the convergence criteria for the Bairstow's method.
 *
 * @return The function `pbairstow_even` returns a `std::pair<unsigned int, bool>`. The first
 * element of the pair represents the number of iterations performed, and the second element
 * represents whether the method converged to a solution within the specified tolerance.

/**
 * @brief Horner's rule
 *
 * Horner's rule is a method for evaluating a polynomial of degree degree at a given
 * point x. It involves rewriting the polynomial as a nested multiplication and
 * addition of the form:
 *
 *  P(x) = a_0 + x(a_1 + x(a_2 + ... + x(a_{degree-1} + x(a_n))...))
 *
 * This form allows for efficient evaluation of the polynomial at a given point
 * x using only degree multiplications and degree additions. Horner's rule is commonly
 * used in numerical methods for polynomial evaluation and interpolation.
 *
 * @param[in, out] coeffs1 coeffs1 is a reference to a vector of doubles. It is used to
 * store the coefficients of a polynomial.
 * @param[in] degree The parameter `degree` represents the size of the vector `coeffs1`. It
 * indicates the number of elements in the vector `coeffs1`.
 * @param[in] vr vr is a Vec2 object, which represents a 2D vector. It has two
 * components, vr.x() and vr.y(), which are used in the calculations inside the
 * horner function.

 * @return a Vec2 object.
